# Project overview 
This project involves the design and implementation of two types of boards: a Slave board and a Master board. The Slave board is responsible for managing the charge, discharge, and balancing of individual cell batteries. The Master board provides a scalable feature that can be implemented on a larger battery pack. The source code for the Slave board is shared in this repository, while the Master code can be programmed based on the specific needs of each project. The overall objective of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient solution for managing battery performance, with a focus on scalability and flexibility.
