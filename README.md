# Project overview 
This project contains two different types of boards: a Slave board and a Master board. The Slave board is responsible for managing battery charge, discharge, and balancing of the cell battery, while the Master board provides the project with a scalable feature that can be implemented on a larger battery pack. In this repository, I am only sharing the source code of the Slave board, and the Master code should be programmed based on individual project needs.
