Battery Management System (BMS) Project
Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Battery Management System (BMS) project, which involves the design and implementation of two types of boards: a Slave board and a Master board. The Slave board is responsible for managing the charge, discharge, and balancing of individual cell batteries. The Master board offers a scalable feature set that can be customized to meet the requirements of larger battery packs.

Features
Slave Board: The Slave board code is shared in this repository and is designed to manage the charge, discharge, and balancing of individual cell batteries. It provides an efficient solution for smaller battery applications.

Master Board: The Master board provides a flexible and scalable platform for managing larger battery packs. The source code for the Master board can be tailored to specific project needs, making it adaptable and versatile.

Reliability and Efficiency: The project aims to deliver a reliable and efficient solution for managing battery performance, with a strong emphasis on scalability and flexibility.
