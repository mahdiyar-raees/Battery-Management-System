this project contains two different types of boards. Slave and Master boards which slave board is responsible for the management of battery charge and discharging and MAster gives the project a scalable feature that could be implemented on the bigger battery pack. in this repository, I only share the source code of the slave board and the master code should be programmed based on individual project needs.
